# Wurtele Center Collaboration Research Project

Sirohi created this GitHub Repository for the versions of the project in order to track coding. 

## Project details
The [Wurtele Center](www.smith.edu/academics/wurtele-center) is a Leadership Center at [Smith College](www.smith.edu) that strives to empower members of the Smith community with an understanding that they can lead from any vantage point, whether they hold positional power or not. 

The Wurtele Center seeks to understand the Smithie perspective of collaboration. This knowledge will inform the Center's future programming and provide a greater general understanding of collegiate collaboration, both inside and outside the classroom. The current study underway involves surveying students as they undertake an intensive collaborative process in one of their classes. Major themes of their experiences are currently being identified using inductive coding methods through the [nVivo software](lumivero.com/products/nvivo/nvivo-product-tour/). This repository is tracking the inductive coding process.
